## Abstract
This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed and verified at the MOSFET (transistor) level in esim. The ALU performs eight operations selected by a 3-bit control word (S2 S1 S0): OR, XNOR, XOR, AND, INC, ADD, DEC, and SUB (see table below). All basic logic gates (NOT, OR, XOR, XNOR, AND) and 2:1 multiplexers were realized as discrete MOSFET circuits using 180 nm technology with Vdd = 5 V; those gates were used as building blocks to create half-adders / half-subtractors and the multi-bit datapath. Multi-bit operations are implemented by replicating the bit-slice circuitry across 8 bits and by appropriate carry handling for arithmetic results. The design includes a dedicated carry flag (MSB) logic so that operations that produce results wider than 1 bit present their MSB as a carry flag; for purely bitwise logical ops the carry flag is forced to 0. Functional verification (opcode sweeps and representative vectors) was performed in esim; schematics and waveforms are included in the report. (Report formatting follows the provided example.)

### Fundamental building blocks
Inverter (NOT) ‚Äî MOSFET implementation.

2-input gates: OR, AND ‚Äî transistor networks implemented in MOSFET style.

XOR, XNOR ‚Äî implemented using MOSFET transistor-level topologies (constructed from the basic gates where appropriate).

2:1 MUX (master primitive) ‚Äî MOSFET-level pass/transmission gate or complementary MUX implementation; this is the fundamental multiplexer building block used to construct larger MUXes.

### Adders / Subtractors
Half-adder building block: implemented using XOR (sum) and AND (carry) primitives. You used these half-adder elements as the basic data path for bitwise addition where appropriate.

Half-subtractor building block: implemented using XOR (difference), AND and NOT (borrow) primitives; used to create bitwise subtraction elements.

Multi-bit arithmetic: the 8-bit arithmetic datapath is built by replicating the bit-slice adder/subtractor logic across all 8 bits. Carry/borrow propagation between bit-slices is used for full multi-bit addition/subtraction (i.e., a ripple style chaining of carry/borrow signals produced by the per-bit adder/subtractor blocks).

Increment / Decrement: implemented by using the adder/subtractor with the second operand tied to logic 1 (Vdd) so that A + 1 and A ‚àí 1 are produced without a separate dedicated incrementer/decrementer block.

### Multiplexer architecture and MSB (carry-flag) selection
LSB..bit outputs: For each of the 8 bits the 8:1 data multiplexer selects which operation‚Äôs bit result is presented to that bit of the ALU output according to S2 S1 S0.

8:1 MUX construction: implemented using seven 2:1 MUX primitives (i.e., a tree of 2:1 multiplexers) ‚Äî all 2:1 MUXes were implemented at MOSFET level.

MSB / carry flag logic: because the last four operations (INC, ADD, DEC, SUB ‚Äî select codes 100..111) can produce a 2-bit result (LSB + MSB/carry), a separate path selects the MSB (carry) for the ALU:

A 4:1 MUX selects the MSB bits produced by the last four arithmetic operations (inputs = the MSBs of INC, ADD, DEC, SUB). This 4:1 MUX is implemented using three 2:1 MUX primitives.

The 4:1 MUX output is fed to the in1 input of a final 2:1 MUX whose select is S2. The in2 of that final 2:1 MUX is tied to GND (logic 0). This arrangement yields:

when S2 = 0 (first four logical ops), the carry flag is forced to 0 (in2 = 0),

when S2 = 1 (last four arithmetic ops), the carry flag equals the selected MSB from the 4:1 MUX (in1).

Why this arrangement: it cleanly separates logical 1-bit outputs (carry = 0) from arithmetic ops that may produce an extra MSB; it also minimizes extra logic by reusing the 2:1 MUX primitive.

### Output format
Primary output: 8-bit result bus (bit 7 = most significant bit of the chosen operation‚Äôs LSB output when weighted as normal).

Carry flag / extra MSB: separate 1-bit carry flag that is the MSB of arithmetic results (selected and gated as described above). For purely logical operations (OR, XNOR, XOR, AND) the carry flag = 0.

### Implementation notes & verification
All gates and multiplexers were designed at transistor level (no behavioral primitives). The 2:1 MUX design was re-used to compose 4:1 and 8:1 multiplexers (3√ó2:1 ‚Üí 4:1; 7√ó2:1 ‚Üí 8:1 tree).

Arithmetic building blocks were constructed from your MOS-level XOR/AND/NOT primitives (you mentioned implementing half-adder and half-subtractor as XOR+AND and XOR+AND+NOT respectively). Those blocks were replicated across 8 bits and connected with carry/borrow chaining for multi-bit add/sub operations.

Increment/Decrement were realized by driving the second operand to logic 1 (Vdd) into the adder/subtractor block.

Simulation checklist (recommended): opcode sweep (all 8 opcodes) on representative vectors (0x00, 0x01, 0x7F, 0x80, 0xFF), verify carry flag behavior for boundary conditions (e.g., 0xFF + 1), and capture timing waveforms for a typical add and a typical logic operation. Include schematic screenshots and waveforms in the report (figure captions: ‚ÄúFig. X ‚Äî MOSFET-level 2:1 MUX‚Äù, ‚ÄúFig. Y ‚Äî 8-bit ALU top-level schematic‚Äù, ‚ÄúFig. Z ‚Äî Waveforms for opcode 101 (ADD) showing carry‚Äù etc.).

## Technology & environment
